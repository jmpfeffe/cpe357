look - display lines beginning with a given string

Usage: 
>> make
>> ./look [-df] [-t termchar] string [file]

Description: Using a binary search, the look tool displays any lines in file which contain string as a prefix.

IMPORTANT: The lines in file MUST be sorted. If a file is not specified, the built-in UNIX dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words) is used, in which only alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) are compared.

Optional Flags:
-d    Only alphanumeric characters are compared.
-f    Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.
-t    Specify a string termination character (i.e. only the characters in string up to and including the first occurrence of termchar are compared).
